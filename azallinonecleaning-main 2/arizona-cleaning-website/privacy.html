    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  </section>

  <section class="privacy-container">
    <p>At Arizona All-In-One Cleaning, your trust and privacy are fundamental to everything we do. Our commitment to protecting your information is central to our operations, whether you’re browsing our website, requesting a quote, or scheduling a cleaning service. We strive to provide complete transparency about how we handle your personal data, including the collection, storage, use, and sharing of that information.</p>

    <p>We believe in clear, open communication, and this Privacy Policy serves to give you peace of mind about how seriously we take your data. Whether you interact with us via our website, mobile forms, or customer support, we ensure every step complies with applicable laws and best practices to keep your personal data safe and used only as needed to serve you better. Our digital infrastructure is built with layered security controls and strict access procedures to minimize risk and maximize trust.</p>

    <p>We collect a range of information to help deliver a seamless cleaning experience. This includes personal identifiers such as your full name, email, phone number, billing address, and information about your property or service preferences. We may also collect usage data—such as browser type, IP address, referring/exit pages, device identifiers, and session duration—to help us understand visitor behavior and optimize our site accordingly.</p>

    <p>When you contact us, request a quote, book a service, or subscribe to updates, we may retain records of that correspondence to ensure future communication is smooth and personalized. This allows us to better serve your individual preferences, track your history of services, resolve issues quickly, and offer relevant promotions based on your prior activity or feedback.</p>

    <p>We use this data to fulfill your service requests, send appointment reminders, process payments, provide invoices, and follow up after cleanings to gather feedback or provide updates. Additionally, we use information to improve our internal processes—evaluating service effectiveness, customer satisfaction, scheduling logistics, and training for our team. Marketing communication is only sent with your explicit consent and you may unsubscribe at any time.</p>

    <p>We take privacy seriously, and we never sell your data to third parties. We may share limited information with service providers who assist us in our operations—such as email platforms, payment processors, and scheduling systems—but only under strict agreements that require confidentiality and data security. These third parties are granted only the information needed to perform their tasks and are prohibited from using your data for any other purpose.</p>

    <p>Your data is stored securely on encrypted systems with limited access. We implement strong security protocols, regular audits, and role-based controls to protect against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse of your data. Our internal team receives regular training on data protection practices and compliance requirements to ensure your privacy is never compromised.</p>

    <p>We retain your data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected—unless a longer retention period is required by law. Once your data is no longer needed, it is deleted from our systems or anonymized for analytical use. You have the right to request access to your personal data, ask for corrections, or request deletion. You may also opt out of communications at any time.</p>

    <p>Our website may contain links to external sites. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those third-party sites. We encourage users to review their policies before submitting any personal information on those platforms. Our privacy policy applies only to data collected directly by Arizona All-In-One Cleaning through our official website or in-person services.</p>

    <p>By using our services, you agree to the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. We may update this policy occasionally to reflect changes in our operations, technology, or regulatory requirements. Any updates will be posted on this page with the updated date, and we encourage users to check it periodically to remain informed about how their data is used and protected.</p>

    <p>We’re here to answer your questions. If you have any concerns about your privacy, data rights, or would like to exercise your rights under this policy, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us directly. Your privacy is not just a legal obligation—it’s a promise of integrity and respect that defines how we do business every single day.</p>
